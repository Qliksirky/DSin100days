q0:  
    question: "What do Graphical Normality tests do?"
    options:  
        a: "Check if our data is normally distributed"
        b: "Test if a sample of the data follows a normal distribution"
        c: "Precisely measures the deviation of our data distribution from a normal distribution"
    question_type: "single"
    answer: "Check if our data is normally distributed"

q1:
    question: "Which of the following is NOT an assumption for linear regression"
    options: 
        a: "We have a linear relationship between the independent variable and the target variable."
        b: "Our data is hetroscedastic"
        c: "Residuals will have a normal distribution"
        d: "Minimal collinearity"
    question_type: "single" 
    answer: "Our data is hetroscedastic"
      
q2:  
    question: "what is a potential pitfall of Histograms?"
    options: 
        a: "Nothing, Histograms always work!"
        b: "Histograms cannot represent a normal distribution"
        c: "How a distribution 'looks' can change on the bin size"
        d:
    question_type: "single"
    answer: "my_dataframe.head(10)"

q3:  
    question: "What does QQ plot stand for?"
    options: 
        a: "Quarter-Quantile plot"
        b: "Quarter-Quarter plot"
        c: "Quantile-Quantile plot"
    question_type: "single"
    answer: "Quantile-Quantile plot"


q4: 
    question: "How can you tell if data is normally distributed using QQ plot"  
    options: 
        a: "The data points must form an s-shaped curve"
        b: "The data points must lie on a straight line"
        c: "The data points must lie on a a guide line that represents a normal distribution"
        d: "The data points should lie on a guide line representing a normal distribution, but edge points might slightly diverse"
    question_type: "single"
    answer: "The data points should lie on a guide line representing a normal distribution, but edge points might slightly diverse"
