(i.e., If x='Hello', then 'x' is automatically identified by python as a string variable. If 'x' is re-assigned a value of 12.6, say x=12.6, then 'x' is automatically identified as a float)"

    "### Format specifiers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to put a placeholder for a variable and pass the value to the function separately, we can use something called format specifier. This is typically a set of symbols which tell the function about the format in which the value being passed is to be printed. Format specifiers for various types of data types in Python are similar to other programming languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* %d for integer\n",
    "* %f for float\n",
    "* %s for string\n",
    "* %r for raw object using 'repr' method\n",
    "* %x for hex code\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the format specifiers as placeholders in a print statement, and pass the value of a specific variable using the '%' operator. Multiple variables/values can also be passed by enclosing all variables in paranthesis and separating them by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"I want to print %d and %d in the same sentence\"%(a,b))\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> I want to print 10 and 5 in the same sentence\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10.264725\n",
    "b = \"a string type\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"I want to print %f and %s in the same sentence\"%(a,b))\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> I want to print 10.264725 and a string type in the same sentence\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternative to the '%' operator, we have the format() function which can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"I want to print {:d} and {:d} in the same sentence\".format(a,b))\n",

    "#### Rounding off a float and adding preceeding zeroes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, where we had a float value, we may want to restrict the number of decimals and print a rounded value. On the other hand we may want to add a preceeding zero to the number, in case the value a here is a single observation in a larger pool of numbers which have 3 digits before the decimal.\n",
    "We can add preceeding zeroes and round off float values by specifying the type of formatting for a float, after the '%' symbol and before the 'f' symbol of the format specifier.\n",
    "* Use a period symbol ('.') to denote the decimal in the float value\n",
    "* For preceeding zeroes, add total desired length of the number (including decimal point), in digits, before the period symbol. And before this number, add a '0' to denote that all preceeding blank spaces need to be filled with zeroes.\n",
    "* For rounding off decimals, add the number up to which you want decimals, right after the period symbol and before the 'f' symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/format_specifiers.png\">\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "print('''Variations of a floating point:\n",
    "1. {:.2f}\n",
    "2. {:.3f}\n",
    "3. {:4.4f}\n",
    "4. {:04.4f}\n",
    "5. {:8.4f}\n",
    "6. {:08.4f}\n",

    ">>> 1. 10.26\n",

    ">>> 4. 10.2647\n",
    ">>> 5.  10.2647\n",
    ">>> 6. 010.2647\n",
    ">>> 7. 00010.2647\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Important note:</b> In above example '{:4.4f}' and '{04.4f}' give the same output, where we cannot see any padding (neither blanks nor zeroes). This is because the length that we specified for the string is 4, whereas we have also asked for 4 digits after the decimal point. So the digits after decimal take precedence and these 4 digits are added first.\n",
    "Then the whole number is generated - the characteristic (digits before decimal) and the mantissa (digits after the decimal). After this the control checks to add padding. It now finds that the condition for length of number we have specified is 4, and the length of number is already more than 4, hence it does not add any padding blanks or zeroes.\n",

This notation retrieves all elements of the list starting from the lower index up to the upper index.\n",
    "* Using two colons to separate two indices and an iterator: A second colon can be used to separate the upper index with an iterator. The iterator is a number which determines the increment the index will take while traversing the list/array. By default this number is '1', so the index increases one place at a time, i.e., next index = previous index + increment.\n",

    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is an unordered <b>collection of unique objects</b>. Sets are collection types and very useful for Mathematicians, Statisticians and Data Scientists. It is equivalent to the mathematical definition of sets. Sets in python are defined using the function 'set()'. Any list, or array type can also be recast into a set, using the set() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when a list containing multiple occurrences of a specific element is passed to a set() function, the resulting set contains only unique elements (single occurrence) and not all occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "even_number_set = set([0, 2, 4, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "list_A = [25,1,2,3,\"Hello\",2,4,3,2,4,7,\"Hello\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(even_number_set, \"\\n\", set(list_A))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> {0, 2, 4, 6}\n",
    ">>> {'Hello', 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by definition a set is an <b>'unordered'</b> collection of objects. In the above output, the set form of list_A is printed in a sorted order. However, that is merely the output of the set() function and that is not how the elements in the set itself are organized. The set does not support indexing as the elements/objects are not stored in any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using sets to reduce the search space:</b>\n",
    "One way we can use sets is if we would like to check the existence of a certain object in a very large collection of frequently repeating objects. We may create a set, which has only unique elements and thereby reduces the list size drastically. Then the decreased range is easier to iterate through and find the existence of the current object using the 'in' membership operator.\n",
