    "# Intro to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple, easy-to-learn, pseudo-code resembling programming language. It is rich with all the features of any object oriented language. Scientists and Mathematicians have been using python since its inception and hence is popular for analytical tasks. Python is also known for its brevity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Python - the origins </li>\n",
    "<li>Features of Python language</li>\n",
    "<li>Why is Python a Favorite of Data Scientists </li>\n",
    "<li>Python Standard Library </li>\n",

    "## Python - the origins \n",
    "\n",
    "Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum in the year 1989, as a pet project. It was first released to the public in the year 1991. Initially python was written as \"a scripting language with a syntax like ABC language but with access to the Amoeba distributed operating system calls developed at CWI, Netherlands (https://www.cwi.nl/about)\", as mentioned by the author of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read this link for detailed write-up regarding the need for creating Python - https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place\n",
    "\n",
    "From the language users' perspective, the Python programming language was considered a gap-filler, a way to write automated scripts to do mundane jobs such as copying files over. Later over the years it has been used in various scenarios from automated testing, DevOps to deploy applications, rapid application prototyping,  Web app development using Frameworks such as Django, and to do scientific research programming.\n",
    "Eventually Python has become the language of choice for Data Science and Machine Learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was made possible due to the fact that the language is extensible via modules and libraries. Various libraries have been developed and added to Python world over the years in areas as wide ranging as WebApp Frameworks to Statistics and Machine Learning.\n",

    "## Features of the Python language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy language to learn and use. The language is designed in such a way that it is easy to write code, even when you are starting to learn it. Similarly it is easy read python code written by others and understand it. For example consider the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code is intuitive and does exactly what it reads like. That is, it prints the text \"Hello World\".\n",
    "Intdentation is built-in feature of python language. This makes it easy to read the code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sayHello():\n",
    "    print('Hello world')\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code snippet, the function definition line is followed by a statement, print in ths case, whci is indented. This indicates that the statement is part of the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well Supported and Widely Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been hugely popular and widely used for several types of applications. Python is available on all major Operating Systems and platforms. Many libraries are available in python including Statistics, Machine Learning libraries etc. Python has wrappers for various APIs and native components using C. Python is a versatile language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### General Application Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to create both command-line, Web Apps and cross-platform GUI applications. There are GUI modules such as TkInter to develop GUI apps. You can deploy them as self-contained executables using packages such as cx_Freeze and PyInstaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Application Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to for developing enterprise web applications using Web App frames such as Flask and Django. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Persistence and Data Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in support for Data Persistence with suport for SQLite library. It has support for JSON handling (https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html), XML parsing using DOM and SAX parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional help with SQLite3 Data library in python, refer to the link: https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamically Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed (or duck typed), meaning the data types need not be specified unlike the static typed languages such as C or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "For programmers from java or C background, there is a separate version of python called mypy that allows static typing. This provides a way for using python with static typing if your code deserves it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to mypy http://mypy-lang.org/examples.html.\n",

    "## Why is Python a Favorite of Data Scientists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is interactive and has a lot of flexibility such as not necessitating declaration of complex types of variables. This helps Data Scientists easily translate their ideas into experiments. Python offers extensive libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn. Any area of Data Science will most likely have libraries in python available. We shall therefore be using Python throughout the course.  Let us refresh some of the concepts in python starting with variables. The Machine Learning/AI Engineers use the object-oriented programming for writing production code. \n"

    "## The Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard library contains a variety of components such as data types, built-in functions and exceptions, and a collection of modules. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the categories and built-in libraries are included below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Functions\n",
    " \n",
    " Some of the typical built-in functions are :\n",
    " print() - for printing to system output\n",
    " str() -  to convert an object to a printable string\n",
    " int() - to return an integer object from a number or string (with digits only)\n",
    " file() - Constructor for file object representing a file.\n",
    " open() - to open a file for reading, writing or appending.\n",
    " \n",
    " etc.\n",
    " \n",
    " For an exhaustive list of built-in functions please refer to this link : https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#built-in-funcs\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Built-in Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The python language contains several built-in types. The principal built-in types are <b>numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes, instances</b> and <b>exceptions.</b> This includes the data types and several other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four distinct numeric types: <b>plain integers, long integers, floating point numbers,</b> and <b>complex numbers.</b> In addition, Booleans are a subtype of plain integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are seven sequence types: <b>strings, Unicode strings, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers,</b> and <b>xrange objects.</b> For example, String literals are sequences which are written in single or double quotes: 'xyzzy', \"frobozz\". Unicode strings are much like strings, but are specified in the syntax using a preceding 'u' character: u'abc', u\"def\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also <b>dict</b>, which is a Map Type and <b>set</b> which is part of Set types within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callable Types are types which can be invoked from python statements - such as <b>User-defined functions, User-defined (class) Methods, Class Types</b> and <b>Class Instances</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details refer to this link : https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### String operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Library provides some string operations using string module such as lowercase(), uppercase() to convert string to lower case or upper case respectively. In addition it has several functions such as format() for string formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 're' module provides regular expressions for advanced string searchin and handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed explanation of strings and operations is provided in subsequent lessons later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other packages in standard library pertains to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Data Type operations</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Numerical & Mathematical operations </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> File Access operations </li>\n",
    "\n",
