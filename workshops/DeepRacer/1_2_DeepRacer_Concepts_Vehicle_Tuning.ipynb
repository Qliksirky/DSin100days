    "\n",
    "Now that you have learned about how the AWS DeepRacer uses Reinforcement Learning to train itself so that it can complete the race course, let’s dive into some of the technology that makes it possible and how you as the programmer can customize different things to make your DeepRacer quicker than your competitors.  This Micro Course will focus on guiding you through the process of building your own DeepRacer online, and you can get to this page by selecting the “Your Garage” option on the left hand bar underneath “Reinforcement Learning”.  Next, you will click the “Build New Vehicle”. \n",

    "The DeepRacer car uses a camera as its primary means of navigating the race course.  The camera helps the DeepRacer determine if it is on/off the race course, how close it is to the middle of the track, and all other information required.  It does this by taking 15 pictures per second of the track in front of it.  It then feeds each picture into a neural network, which in conjunction with your reward function, trains your DeepRacer.  This means that the images taken by the camera are the input that your reward function works off of.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 camera options that you, the programmer, can choose from for your DeepRacer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The first, and standard option, is a traditional single camera.  This camera has a 120 degree field of vision, meaning it can see things up to 60 degrees to the left and 60 degrees to the right of its center point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of a singular camera for your DeepRacer is that you can train your model quicker because there is only a singular stream of inputs into your neural network.  Another benefit is that it is the simplest, and cheapest (cost-wise) option that will function at a high level on time trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other option that you as the programmer must consider, is a stereo camera.  A stereo camera is composed of two single lense cameras that both simultaneously take pictures.  This camera option, even though it has two cameras within it, has the same field of vision capabilities as a singular capability.  The most impactful difference and advantage of the stereo option is that because there are now two cameras, depth can now be perceived by the DeepRacer more easily.  This is a huge advantage for the Object Avoidance and Head-to-Head events.  However, the largest drawback is that with two cameras comes twice as many pictures, and so the neural network will take significantly longer to train and fine tune your DeepRacer’s racing abilities.  That being said, the results of your DeepRacer may be better because your neural network will have more inputs to work with than it would with a singular camera system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You as the programmer must decide which camera is best suited for your competition by weighing the advantages and disadvantages to each option.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other important part of the DeepRacer that you should learn about as the programmer is the LIDAR Sensor add-on.  The LIDAR Sensor should be used exclusively for events in which other objects populate the track (if you plan on just competing in time trials you can skip this explanation as you will not be using LIDAR).  The LIDAR sensor allows the DeepRacer to always know its distance to all other objects, such as other DeepRacers or obstacles on the course.  This helps the DeepRacer with obstacle avoidance actions, such as passing another DeepRacer in a Head-to-Head race.  The major drawback of LIDAR sensors in real life is how expensive they are.  However for the online simulations of DeepRacer you should 100% equip it for Obstacle Avoidance and Head-to-Head events.\n",

    "In addition to choosing the type of camera system your DeepRacer will use, there are 4 values that you also have control over that will greatly impact how your DeepRacer operates.  These four values will determine how many different possible action options your DeepRacer will have at its disposal during training and the events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first value is Maximum Steering Angle.  Steering Angle is the maximum degree that the wheels can turn left or right of the center of the car.  The higher the value the more the wheels can turn left or right, the lower the value the less so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is Steering Angle Granularity.  This is how fine you want the steering angle to be divided.  For example, a steering angle granularity of 5 will allow the DeepRacer to turn at -30, -15, 0, 15, 30 while a steering angle granularity of 3 allows for only -30, 0, 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third is Maximum Speed.  This is pretty self explanatory, and while obviously you should want your DeepRacer to drive as fast as possible, remember that the higher your maximum speed the harder it is to slow down.  This will make navigating through corners or redirecting itself to stay on track more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final value is Speed Granularity.  This is how much you want the DeepRacer’s speed to be divided by.  So with a max speed of 3 and a speed granularity of 2 your DeepRacer will allow actions of solely 3m/s and 1.5m/s, where as if the speed granularity was 1 then your DeepRacer will only allow actions at a speed of 3m/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the values you give for these four options, the Action List at the bottom of the page will change.  The screenshot below is an example in which the maximum steering angle is 30 degrees, the steering angle granularity is 5, maximum speed is 3m/s, and the speed granularity is 2.\n"

    "This action list is all of the potential actions that your DeepRacer can choose from while training or racing, and is a combination of all possible steering angles and speeds based on the four input values described above.  This means that the number of actions will be the steering angle granularity multiplied by the speed granularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Helpful Tips: \n",
    "In general, a larger number of actions and larger action ranges give your DeepRacer more options to react to more varied track conditions, such as a curved track with irregular turning angles or directions.  The more options available to the DeepRacer, the more readily it can handle track variations.  As a result, you can expect the trained model to be more widely applicable, even when using a simple reward function.  For example, your DeepRacer can learn quickly to handle straight-line track using a smaller action space with a small number of speeds and steering angles.  On a curved track, this lack of options within the action space is likely to cause the DeepRacer to overshoot and go off the track while it turns.  If you increase the number of speeds or the number of steering angles or both, the DeepRacer should become more capable of maneuvering the curves while keeping on the track.  Similarly, if your agent moves in a zig-zag fashion, you can try to increase the number of steering ranges (this would mean increasing the steering angle granularity) to reduce drastic turns at any given step.  However, it is important to note that while it is good to have more options, it will take longer to train your model the more actions that are on your Action List.  \n",
