    "__Note:__ This exercise is designed to be completed in your AWS account. AWS DeepRacer is part of AWS Free Tier, so you can get started with the service at no cost. For the first month after sign-up, you are offered a monthly free tier of 10 hours of Amazon SageMaker training, and 60 simulation units of Amazon RoboMaker (enough to cover 10 hours of training). If you go beyond those free tier limits, you will accrue additional costs. For more information see the AWS DeepRacer Pricing page."
