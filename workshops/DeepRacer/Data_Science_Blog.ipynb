    "A [LinkedIn post by Eric Weber](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eric-weber-060397b7_data-datascience-activity-6690273159121297408-FJsX/) on career paths originating from Data Science started me thinking along the same lines. Through this blog, it is my humble intention to curate different career paths that have evolved as well as speculate on how these new roles came into being. <br>\n",
    "When I first started hearing about Data Science, way back in the early 2000s, some of the earliest roles were a Data analyst. At that point of time, it seemed like an outgrowth from the Data entry roles which came into existence in the late 20th century. And then in 2011, McKinsey came out with its paper [“Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity”](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/big-data-the-next-frontier-for-innovation) which brought to the forefront the inability of many organizations to harness the power of data because of lack of skilled personnel. [Visharg Shah’s article on Medium](https://medium.com/@vishargshah/why-the-sudden-boom-of-data-science-56315e141f32) explains how the field of data science grew rapidly. the reasons can be summarized as  due to these reasons –<br>\n",
    "* Exponential growth in data collected from various sources by companies\n",
    "* Massive growth in processing power and processing capacity towards the analysis process\n",
    "* Availability of tools for analysis and open access to frameworks and modules simplifying the task\n",
    "* Organizations finding value in analyzing historic data and big data collected\n",
    "* Increased importance in using data for decision-making augmenting traditional methods\n",
    "* Democratization of data science leading to increasing adoption by most industry segments\n",
    "* Digitization of historic data especially those held by public agencies \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Even as the companies scrambled to hire the best data science talent, they conceded that the job market sorely lacked talent for these roles.<br><br>\n",
    "Following that by mid 2015s, the roles had evolved into the roles of Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Business Analyst. The roles were segmented within the field of Data science depending on skills needed and role within organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As companies have started to dig deeper into their data, they realized that a person with just knowledge of data science might not be enough. Organizations expected more from their hires, seeking those – Who knew what type of data they were dealing with, who had domain expertise in the industry, what insights can be developed, how to visualize these analytics, predict trends in industry etc. New roles came into existence like Linguistics Analyst (Uses knowledge of different cultures to provide accurate picture for decision makers including dialect, nuances, body language and cultural context) or Sustainable Chemistry Analyst (Performs product testing, maintaining database of sustainable chemicals with extensive operational responsibilities). Thus, we can see that at a basic level, the roles have not changed much and yet they have.\n",

    "If we look at the highlighted content, we can see clearly how this Amazon seeks to utilize data science for procurement roles. Understanding data points, KPIs and other industry thought processes and finally data driven decision making become important along with a need to have domain expertise. For someone beginning to learn data sciences, it is essential to find application areas and actively work on projects to remain relevant in the job market. I believe that future trends would lead to even more specialization based on software/applications as well as industry segments and thus resulting in more roles.\n",
