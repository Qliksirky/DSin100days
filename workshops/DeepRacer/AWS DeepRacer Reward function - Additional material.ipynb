Use a larger batch size to promote more stable and smooth updates to the neural network weights, but be aware of the possibility that the training may be longer or slower.\n",

    "__6. Loss type__\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of the objective function to update the network weights. A good training algorithm should make incremental changes to the vehicleâ€™s strategy so that it gradually transitions from taking random actions to taking strategic actions to increase reward. But if it makes too big a change then the training becomes unstable and the agent ends up not learning. The Huber and Mean squared error loss types behave similarly for small updates. But as the updates become larger, the Huber loss takes smaller increments compared to the Mean squared error loss. When you have convergence problems, use the Huber loss type. When convergence is good and you want to train faster, use the Mean squared error loss type.\n",

    "__7. Number of experience episodes between each policy-updating iteration__\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the experience buffer used to draw training data from for learning policy network weights. An episode is a period in which the vehicle starts from a given starting point and ends up completing the track or going off the track. Different episodes can have different lengths. For simple reinforcement-learning problems, a small experience buffer may be sufficient and learning will be fast. For more complex problems which have more local maxima, a larger experience buffer is necessary to provide more uncorrelated data points. In this case, training will be slower but more stable. The recommended values are 10, 20 and 40."
